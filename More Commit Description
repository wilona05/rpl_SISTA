1. Updated "Registrasi Sidang"
- It can now update both the sidangta and dosensidang tables in the database.

2. Replaced "Sidang" folder and modified its contents to suit "SidangTA" folder
- Both SidangTA and InfoSidang class has no differences, later I'll try to find a way to only use one of them.

3. Added an SQL file to create VIEW
- Modified a few methods from JdbcSidangTARepository into am SQL VIEW, to put fewer rows of codes in Java.

4. Updated HTML and CSS for "daftarPengguna"
- Each user item will now show "email", "nama", and "role", in a fixed style.

5. DashboardKoordinator can now show sidang item based on role, however, this is not implemented on DashboardDosen yet.
- And we can't see the information for each sidang item by clicking the button yet, will be fixed later.

On progress:
- DashboardDosen
- InfoSidang
